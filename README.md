# Crypto package for dart_mobile

This package is made to provide cryptographic functions for flutter application.

Those functions should be implemented and appropriately tested:

- Cryptographic key generation (custom bit length)
- Saving keys to local storage
- Loading keys from local storage
- Exporting private key to string PEM from local storage
- Importing private key to local storage from string PEM
- Exporting public key to string base64 from local storage
- Signing custom string messages with private key
